# I Build A Prompt That Can Make Any Prompt 10x Better

Some people asked me for this prompt, I DM'd them but I thought to myself might as well share it with sub instead of gatekeeping lol. Anyway, these are duo prompts, engineered to elevate your prompts from mediocre to professional level. One prompt evaluates, the other one refines. You can use them separately until your prompt is perfect.

This prompt is different because of how flexible it is, the evaluation prompt evaluates across 35 criteria, everything from clarity, logic, tone, hallucination risks and many more. The refinement prompt actually crafts your prompt, using those insights to clean, tighten, and elevate your prompt to elite form. This prompt is flexible because you can customize the rubrics, you can edit wherever results you want. You don't have to use all 35 criteria, to change you edit the evaluation prompt (prompt 1).

## How To Use It (Step-by-step)

1. Evaluate the prompt: Paste the first prompt into ChatGPT, then paste YOUR prompt inside triple backticks, then run it so it can rate your prompt across all the criteria 1-5.

2. Refine the prompt: just paste then second prompt, then run it so it processes all your critique and outputs a revised version that's improved.

3. Repeat: you can repeat this loop as many times as needed until your prompt is crystal-clear.

## 🎯 Evaluation Instructions

1. **Review the prompt** provided inside triple backticks (```).
2. **Evaluate the prompt** using the **35-criteria rubric** below.
3. For **each criterion**:
   - Assign a **score** from 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent).
   - Identify **one clear strength**.
   - Suggest **one specific improvement**.
   - Provide a **brief rationale** for your score (1–2 sentences).
4. **Validate your evaluation**:
   - Randomly double-check 3–5 of your scores for consistency.
   - Revise if discrepancies are found.
5. **Simulate a contrarian perspective**:
   - Briefly imagine how a critical reviewer might challenge your scores.
   - Adjust if persuasive alternate viewpoints emerge.
6. **Surface assumptions**:
   - Note any hidden biases, assumptions, or context gaps you noticed during scoring.
7. **Calculate and report** the total score out of 175.
8. **Offer 7–10 actionable refinement suggestions** to strengthen the prompt.

> ⏳ **Time Estimate:** Completing a full evaluation typically takes 10–20 minutes.

### ⚡ Optional Quick Mode

If evaluating a shorter or simpler prompt, you may:
- Group similar criteria (e.g., group 5-10 together)
- Write condensed strengths/improvements (2–3 words)
- Use a simpler total scoring estimate (+/- 5 points)

Use full detail mode when precision matters.

## 💡 Example Evaluations

### Good Example

```markdown
1. Clarity & Specificity – 4/5  
   - Strength: The evaluation task is clearly defined.  
   - Improvement: Could specify depth expected in rationales.  
   - Rationale: Leaves minor ambiguity in expected explanation length.
```

### Poor Example

```markdown
1. Clarity & Specificity – 2/5  
   - Strength: It's about clarity.  
   - Improvement: Needs clearer writing.  
   - Rationale: Too vague and unspecific, lacks actionable feedback.
```

## 🎯 Audience

This evaluation prompt is designed for **intermediate to advanced prompt engineers** (human or AI) who are capable of nuanced analysis, structured feedback, and systematic reasoning.

---

## 🧠 Additional Notes

- Assume the persona of a **senior prompt engineer**.
- Use **objective, concise language**.
- **Think critically**: if a prompt is weak, suggest concrete alternatives.
- **Manage cognitive load**: if overwhelmed, use Quick Mode responsibly.
- **Surface latent assumptions** and be alert to context drift.
- **Switch frames** occasionally: would a critic challenge your score?  
- **Simulate vs predict**: Predict typical responses, simulate expert judgment where needed.

✅ *Tip: Aim for clarity, precision, and steady improvement with every evaluation.*
